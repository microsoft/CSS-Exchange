.DESCRIPTION
    This is the function that you call to collect information for the Exchange Servers.
    It is responsible to setup and determine if we need to do jobs for particular actions or if we need to execute the code
    within the main PowerShell session.
    It will wait for all the jobs to have been completed, then create the proper data structure for the Health Checker analyzer to process.
    Then it will return a list of those object back to the caller.
