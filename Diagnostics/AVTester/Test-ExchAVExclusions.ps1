	Requires: Administrator rights
    Major Release History:
        06/16/2021 - Initial Release

.SYNOPSIS
Uses EICA7 files to verify that all Exchange paths that should be excluded from AV scanning are excluded.

.DESCRIPTION
Writes an EICAR test file https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file to all paths specified by
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/Exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/windows-antivirus-software?view=exchserver-2019 and
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/anti-virus-software-in-the-operating-system-on-exchange-servers-exchange-2013-help


If the file is removed then the path is not properly excluded from AV Scanning.
IF the file is not removed then it should be properly excluded.

Once the files are created it will wait 60 seconds for AV to "see" and remove the file.

.PARAMETER Recurse
Will test not just the root folders but all subfolders.
Generally should not be needed unless all folders pass without -Recuse but AV is still suspected.

.OUTPUTS
Log file:
$env:LOCALAPPDATA\ExchAvExclusions.log

List of Scanned Folders:
$env:LOCALAPPDATA\BadFolders.txt

.EXAMPLE
.\Test-ExchAVExclusions.ps1

Puts and removes an EICAR file in all test paths.

.EXAMPLE
.\Test-ExchAVExclusions.ps1 -Recurse

Puts and Remove an EICAR file in all test paths + all subfolders.
