.SYNOPSIS
    Tries to builds a timeline of the history of the meeting based on the diagnostic objects.

.DESCRIPTION
    By using the time sorted diagnostic objects for one user on one meeting, we try to give a high level
    overview of what happened to the meeting. This can be use to get a quick overview of the meeting and
    then you can look into the CalLog in Excel to get more details.

    The timeline will skip a lot of the noise (isIgnorable) in the CalLogs. It skips EBA (Event Based Assistants),
    and other EXO internal processes, which are (99% of the time) not interesting to the end user and just setting
    hidden internal properties (i.e. things like HasBeenIndex, etc.)

    It also skips items from Shared Calendars, which are calendars that have a Modern Sharing relationship setup,
    which creates a replicated copy of another users. If you want to look at the actions this user took on
    another users calendar, you can look at that users Calendar Logs.

.NOTES
    The timeline will never be perfect, but if you see a way to make it more understandable, readable, etc.,
    please let me know or fix it yourself on GitHub.
    I use a iterative approach to building this, so it will get better over time.
