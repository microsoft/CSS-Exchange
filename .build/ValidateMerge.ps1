.SYNOPSIS
    Validates that no files in a PR have an older commit time than they do in main.
.DESCRIPTION
    Consider that the version number of a script is the commit time of the most recent commit
    of any file included in that script. Further, consider that PRs can be merged out of order.
    An older commit could be merged after a newer commit. In this scenario, the version number
    of the script has already been set to the newer commit, and the version does not increment
    when the script is modified by the older commit.

    This script validates that no files in a PR have an older commit time than they do in main.
    If they do, we instruct the user to rebase against main. The rebase will update the commit
    time to be the time of the rebase, which will then be newer than main, causing the script
    version to increment as expected.
