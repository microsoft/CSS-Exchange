# HealthChecker

Download the latest release: [HealthChecker.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/releases/latest/download/HealthChecker.ps1)

The Exchange Server Health Checker script helps detect common configuration issues that are known to cause performance issues and other long running issues that are caused by a simple configuration change within an Exchange Environment. It also helps collect useful information of your server to help speed up the process of common information gathering of your server.


## Requirements
#### Supported Exchange Server Versions:
The script can be used to validate the configuration of the following Exchange Server versions:
- Exchange Server 2013
- Exchange Server 2016
- Exchange Server 2019

#### Required Permissions:
Please make sure that the account used is a member of the `Local Administrator` group. This should be fulfilled on Exchange servers by being a member of the  `Organization Management` group. However, if the group membership was adjusted or in case the script is executed on a non-Exchange system like a management server, you need to add your account to the `Local Administrator` group. You also need to be a member of the following groups:

- Organization Management
- Domain Admins (only necessary for the `DCCoreRatio` parameter)
