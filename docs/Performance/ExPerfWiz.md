# Initial Run
Run .\ExPerfWiz.ps1 from an elevated shell.

* You will be prompted to setup a default collector on the current server.
* Selecting Y will configure but not start a default collector on the current server.

  `New-ExPerfWiz -FolderPath C:\ExPerfWiz -server RemoteExchServer`

### Collect data from multiple servers

`Get-ExchangeServer | Foreach {New-ExPerfWiz -FolderPath C:\ExPerfWiz -StartOnCreate -Server $_.name}`

# Important Notes
* The default duration is 8 hours to save on disk space meaning that the data collection will stop after 8 hours.
* Using -Threads should only be done if needed to troubleshoot the issue.  It will SIGNIFICANTLY increase the size of the resulting perfmon files.
* Do not stop the log gathering thru the Perfmon GUI that can result in an unreadable log file.  Always stop the data gathering with Stop-ExPerfWiz.
