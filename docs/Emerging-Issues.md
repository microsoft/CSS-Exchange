You may observe emails building up in the transport queues of Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2019. The issue does not impact Exchange 2013 servers.<BR><BR>Following events may be noticed in the application log:<BR><BR> Log Name: Application<BR>Source: FIPFS<BR>Logged: 1/1/2022 1:03:42 AM <BR> Event ID: 5300 <BR> Level: Error <BR>Computer: server1.contoso.com<BR>Description: The FIP-FS "Microsoft" Scan Engine failed to load. PID: 23092, Error Code: 0x80004005.<BR>Error Description: Can't convert "2201010001" to long. <BR><BR> Log Name: Application <BR> Source: FIPFS <BR> Logged: 1/1/2022 11:47:16 AM <BR> Event ID: 1106 <BR> Level: Error <BR> Computer: server1.contoso.com <BR> Description: The FIP-FS Scan Process failed initialization. Error: 0x80004005. Error Details: Unspecified error. | The problem relates to a date check failure with the change of the new year and it not a failure of the AV engine itself. This is not an issue with malware scanning or the malware engine, and it is not a security-related issue. The version checking performed against the signature file is causing the malware engine to crash, resulting in messages being stuck in transport queues. | Run [this script](https://aka.ms/ResetScanEngineVersion) on each Exchange server in your organization. You can run this script on multiple servers in parallel.
