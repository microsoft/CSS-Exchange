The Exchange scenario is a common set of counters for Exchange Server, similar to what ExPerfWiz would collect. None is a completely empty counter set.</p> <p>-IncludeCounters and -ExcludeCounters perform a StartsWith match against the counter name. This makes it possible to collect a large number of counters with minimal syntax. For example:</p> <p><pre><code>.\\SimplePerf.ps1 -Start -IncludeCounters \"\\MSExchange\", \"\\Microsoft Exchange\"\n</code></pre> This example starts a SimplePerf using the Exchange scenario, but then it includes every counter starting with either MSExchange or Microsoft Exchange.</p> <p><pre><code>.\\SimplePerf.ps1 -Start -IncludeCounters \"\\MSExchange\", \"\\Microsoft Exchange\" -Scenario \"None\"\n</code></pre> This example starts a SimplePerf collecting all the matching Exchange counters without including any default counters at all, because the None scenario was specified.</p> <p><pre><code>.\\SimplePerf.ps1 -Start -ExcludeCounters \"\\MSExchange Transport\"\n</code></pre> In this example, we use the Exchange scenario as a starting point, but then we remove all counters starting with MSExchange Transport.</p> <p>Note that individual counters can be excluded even if the counter set has been included. To illustrate:</p> <p> In this screenshot we see all the counters that exist for the Thread set.</p> <p> If we tell SimplePerf to include \"\\Thread\", then it simply collects the whole object.</p> <p> However, if we tell it to Include \"\\Thread\" but exclude \"\\Thread(*)\\Priority\", we see that it has correctly expanded the Thread object and is collecting all counters except \"Priority Current\" and \"Priority Base\".</p> <p>This filtering mechanism makes it easy to customize the counter set with minimal text. To check the result of your counter filters, add the -Verbose switch, or check the counters txt file in $env:TEMP.</p> <p>Note that the resulting set can only show counters that exist on the local machine.

Please remember: If you plan to do the update immediately (means CU + SU installation) Extended Protection does not need to be switched off. If you plan to stay on the CU without installing the SU immediately, you must disable Extended Protection (find the required steps above) as the CU without the SU being installed doesn't support Extended Protection and therefore, you'll experience client connectivity issues.</p> <p>Q: Is it safe to enable Windows Extended Protection on an environment that uses Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) for OWA?
