# Security scripts

## Test-ProxyLogon.ps1

Formerly known as Test-Hafnium, this script automates all four of the commands found in the [Hafnium blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/). It also has a progress bar and some performance tweaks to make the CVE-2021-26855 test run much faster.

The most typical usage of this script is to check all Exchange servers and save the reports,
by using the following syntax from Exchange Management Shell:

`Get-ExchangeServer | .\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs`

To check the local server only, just run the script:

`.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs`

To check the local server and copy the identified logs and files to the OutPath:

`.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -OutPath $home\desktop\logs -CollectFiles`

To display the results without saving them, pass -DisplayOnly:

`.\Test-ProxyLogon.ps1 -DisplayOnly`

## ExchangeMitigations.ps1
This script contains 4 mitigations to help address the following vulnerabilities:

* CVE-2021-26855
* CVE-2021-26857
* CVE-2021-27065
* CVE-2021-26858

For more information on each mitigation please visit https://aka.ms/exchangevulns

**This should only be used as a temporary mitigation until your Exchange Servers can be fully patched, recommended guidance is to apply all of the mitigations at once.**

For this script to work you must have the IIS URL Rewrite Module installed which can be done via this script using the -FullPathToMSI parameter.

For IIS 10 and higher URL Rewrite Module 2.1 must be installed, you can download version 2.1 here:

* x86 & x64 -https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite

For IIS 8.5 and lower Rewrite Module 2.0 must be installed, you can download version 2.0 here:

* x86 - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5747

* x64 - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7435

Installing URL Rewrite version 2.1 on IIS versions 8.5 and lower may cause IIS and Exchange to become unstable. If there is a mismatch between the URL Rewrite module and IIS version, ExchangeMitigations.ps1 will not apply the mitigation for CVE-2021-26855. You must uninstall the URL Rewrite module and reinstall the correct version.

Script requires PowerShell 3.0 and later and must be executed from an elevated PowerShell Session.

[Download ExchangeMitigations.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/releases/latest/download/ExchangeMitigations.ps1)

To apply all mitigations with MSI install

`.\ExchangeMitigations.ps1 -FullPathToMSI "FullPathToMSI" -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -ApplyAllMitigations`

To apply all mitigations without MSI install

`.\ExchangeMitigations.ps1 -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -ApplyAllMitigations -Verbose`

To rollback all mitigations

`.\ExchangeMitigations.ps1 -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -RollbackAllMitigation`

To apply multiple or specific mitigations (out of the 4)

`.\ExchangeMitigations.ps1 -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -ApplyECPAppPoolMitigation -ApplyOABAppPoolMitigation`

To rollback multiple or specific mitigations

`.\ExchangeMitigations.ps1 -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -RollbackECPAppPoolMitigation -RollbackOABAppPoolMitigation`

## CompareExchangeHashes.ps1

This script provides a mechanism for malicious file detection on Exchange servers running E13, E16 or E19 versions.
For more information please go to [https://aka.ms/exchangevulns](https://aka.ms/exchangevulns).

[Download CompareExchangeHashes.ps1](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/releases/latest/download/CompareExchangeHashes.ps1)

`.\CompareExchangeHashes.ps1`

The script currently only validates files in exchange virtual directories only, it does not check any files in the IIS root.
**This script needs to be run as administrator**.

The script determines the version of exchange installed on the server and then downloads the hashes for known exchange files from the [published known good hashes of exchange files](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/releases/latest).

The result generated is stored in a file locally with the following format: <ExchangeVersion>_result.csv
If potential malicious files are found during comparision there is an error generated on the cmdline.

To read the output, open the result csv file in excel or in powershell:

`$result = Import-Csv <Path to result file>`

Note: If the server does not have internet connectivity, run the script which would output the exchange versions discovered on the server. The baselines can be downloaded from [published known good hashes of exchange files](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/releases/latest) and re-run the script.

Submitting files for analysis:
* Please submit the output file for analysis in the malware analysis portal [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission). Please add the text "ExchangeMarchCVE" in "Additional Information" field on the portal submission form.
* Instructions on how to use the portal can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/submission-guide).

## BackendCookieMitigation.ps1

This mitigation will filter https requests that contain malicious X-AnonResource-Backend and malformed X-BEResource cookies which were found to be used in CVE-2021-26855.

This will help with defense against the known patterns observed but not the SSRF as a whole. For more information please visit https://aka.ms/exchangevulns.

**For this script to work you must have the IIS URL Rewrite Module installed which can be done via this script using the -FullPathToMSI parameter.**

For IIS 10 and higher URL Rewrite Module 2.1 must be installed, you can download version 2.1 here:

* x86 & x64 -https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite

For IIS 8.5 and lower Rewrite Module 2.0 must be installed, you can download version 2.0 here:

* x86 - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5747

* x64 - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7435

Installing URL Rewrite version 2.1 on IIS versions 8.5 and lower may cause IIS and Exchange to become unstable. If there is a mismatch between the URL Rewrite module and IIS version, BackendCookieMitigation.ps1 will not apply the mitigation for CVE-2021-26855. You must uninstall the URL Rewrite module and reinstall the correct version.

**Script requires PowerShell 3.0 and later and must be executed from an elevated PowerShell Session.**

To apply without MSI install

`PS C:\> BackendCookieMitigation.ps1 -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -Verbose`

To rollback - Note: This does not remove the IIS Rewrite module, only the rules.

`PS C:\> BackendCookieMitigation.ps1 -WebSiteNames "Default Web Site" -RollbackMitigation -Verbose`
